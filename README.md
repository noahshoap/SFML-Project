# SFML-Project

The idea is to be a sort of game engine, but currently it's just random things I've implemented.

## Notes

So, this is pretty much my first semi-serious dive into creating a game engine, or really just a game, it feels wrong to call it an engine.

As you would expect, this is not a good project.  I've done enough research to know there's better ways of doing just about everything -- and I'd like to explore those in the future.  For now, I will keep working on this.
