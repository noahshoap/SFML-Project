# SFML-Project

A simple RPG game implemented in SFML by me, Noah Shoap.

## Notes

So, this is pretty much my first semi-serious dive into creating a game engine, or really just a game, it feels wrong to call it an engine.

As you would expect, this is not a good project.  I've done enough research to know there's better ways of doing just about everything -- and I'd like to explore those in the future.

I'd also like to finally say I've completed a project I've wanted to for a long time, hence, the coding goes on -- regardless of quality.
